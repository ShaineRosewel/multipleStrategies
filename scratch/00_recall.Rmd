# Terms:

* attribute
* MS-DINA: assumes that all items involve the same number of strategies; to answer an item correctly, students are expected to master all attributes required by at least one strategy; assumes that item parameters across different strategies are the same and that the use of each strategy is equally difficult

# Cognitive diagnosis models for multiple strategies

**Problem addressed:**

* Most CDMs assume that all students adopt the same strategy when approaching 
problems in an assessment, which may not be the case in practice
* Ignoring multiple strategies and fitting data using single-strategy CDMs could result in model misspecifications and an inadequate model-data fit, which, in turn, causes concerns as to the validity of inferences.


**Solution proposed:**

* Provides a unified framework to accommodate various condensation rules (e.g.,
conjunctive, disjunctive, and additive) and different strategy selection approaches (i.e., probability-matching, over-matching, and maximizing)
* develop a generalized multiple-strategy CDM for dichotomous response data, which substantially extends the MS-DINA model to provide a more flexible framework for modelling studentsâ€™ responses under multiple strategies. The proposed model uses several popular single-strategy dichotomous CDMs as building blocks, and takes various strategy selection approaches into consideration.



**Estimation procedure:**

Model parameters are estimated using the marginal maximum likelihood estimation
via expectation-maximization algorithm.

**Major CDM components**

* Q-matrix ($J \times K$): does item $j$ measure item $k$
* $K$ binary attributes yield $c = 2^k$ latent classes (unique attribute profile)
* condensation rule: tells what attributes I need to possess to get the item correct
